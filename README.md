# simple-calendar

<strong>This calendar is made for simple daily notes</strong>


<strong>How it works</strong>

Write the notes for each day of the month and only the notes of the day will be displayed, if you prefer you can make several notes for the same day. All notes and the chosen theme are saved in the browser cache.


<strong>How was it done</strong>

HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap


Developed by me and <a href="https://github.com/vimaciel">Vinicius Maciel</a>.

I worked on design and structure codes and Vinicius gave me a big help on Javascript
